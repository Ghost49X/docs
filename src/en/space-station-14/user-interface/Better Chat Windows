##Overview
Allows us to open more than one chat window each with their own filter settings and would also allow us to freely move the chat window around.

## Background
In some games too much chatter on the radio drawns out other more pertinent chat, which can impede RP or departmental chats.

## The rest?
This proposal offers a way to better organize the flood of information into separate chat windows each with their own filters.
Turning off radio filters is another option, but then good luck scrolling up to find anything you missed.
I'm open to hear about more additional features directly linked to the chat window UI. I'm considering something like chat window tabs as another organizational tool.
